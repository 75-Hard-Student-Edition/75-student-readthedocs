Future Improvements 
===================

This is a list of future improvements which we believe should take priority
if development of the app should continue. These improvements have been derived 
by looking at the shortcomings of the app and comparing it to the original specification
which was derived from several interviews with students.

******************
Account Management
******************
- Encrypt user data (especially passwords)

- 3rd party authentication

- Account recovery options

***************
Task Management
***************

- A mechanism by which the app detects a day has passed in order to generate the next day's schedule

- A summary of the next day's schedule

- Location-sensitive tasks (Location can be manually assigned to tasks)

  - Task can only be marked complete if the user is at that location

  - Notifications when a user nears a location attached to a task

  - Suggestion to reschedule task if user moves away from designated area

- The ability to import other calendars

- Photo / document attachments to tasks

- Pie chart visualisation of how time is split between tasks of different categories

- The ability to view task completion statistics over various time periods (day, week, month)

*********
Reminders
*********

- Allow creation of arbitrary reminders with attributes including title, description, date, time, and optional notes

- Allow users to postpone reminders (with a "Remind Me Later") button such that the reminder can be rescheduled from a selection of predefined intervals (e.g. 5, 10, 15, 30 mins, 1, 2, 3 hours etc.)

- Automatic reminders (notifications) for tasks or imported calendar events

  - The time between the start of the event and the reminder is customisable

- Reminders use different sounds for different priority levels

- Send reminders to user when they are using a "blocked" app when they shouldn't be

- Send notification 1 hour before user bedtime

- Track missed notifications and allow user to review these

******
Habits
******

- Allow user to track positive and negative habits, specifying:
  - Name of habit
  - Frequency
  - Duration (i.e. for how long this will be a habit)

- Store history of logged habits which can be viewed

- GUI to visualise habit consistency over time

*****
Sleep
*****

- Allow user to log sleep duration by pressing a button to start timer and ending timer when morning alarm goes off

- Visualise sleep duration over time

************
App Blocking
************

- Allow users to "block" different apps. This entails setting time limits on their usage, and notifying the user when the allotted time has passed

- Alternatively an app can be blocked after a certain time in the day  (to encourage users to not use their phone excessively before bed)
