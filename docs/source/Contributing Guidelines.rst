The repository for the source code and documentation source are public on github although there is no license, 
which means by default all rights are reserved by the creators. 
That being said, we do appreciate contributions.

For those willing to implement new features / fix bugs, we suggest that you clone the repository,
work in a separate branch to main, and create a pull request when you have finished implementing whichever feature.

Also that during your development please follow our :doc:`Code Structure and Conventions`,
as well as writing unit tests for your code and following our :doc:`Error Handling and Debugging` procedure.
We also suggest contributors start with those features outlined in :doc:`Future Improvements`.

Alternatively, if you encounter any issues not mentioned in :doc:`Known Issues and Troubleshooting`, 
please submit issues to the github repository.
