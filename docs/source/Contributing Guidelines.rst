Contributing Guidelines
=======================

First we would like to thank our main contributors:

- Widad Alli / ``widali``

- Dylan Bamgboye / ``upstudent987``

- Charlie Brewis / ``charlie-brewis``

We also want to thank you, the reader, for the contributions you (presumably) intend to make. 

The repository for the source code and documentation source are public on github although there is no license, 
which means by default all rights are reserved by the creators. 
That being said, we do appreciate contributions.

For those willing to implement new features / fix bugs, we suggest that you clone the repository,
work in a separate branch to main, and create a pull request with a clear title/description when you have finished implementing whichever feature.

Also that during your development please follow our :doc:`Code Structure and Conventions`,
as well as writing unit tests for your code and following our :doc:`Error Handling and Debugging` procedure.
We also suggest contributors start with those features outlined in :doc:`Future Improvements`.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

If you encounter any issues, please check the :doc:`Known Issues and Troubleshooting` page
and the `issues`_ page on the github to ensure you aren't submitting a duplicate. 

When submitting a bug report, please include:

*   Steps to reproduce the bug
*   Expected vs actual behaviour
*   Environment (OS, software versions, etc.)
