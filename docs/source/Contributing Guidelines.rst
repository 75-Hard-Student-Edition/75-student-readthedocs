The repository for the source code and documentation source are public on github,
(which perhaps they should not be, because this is a university project)
however there is no license, which means by default all rights are reserved by the creators. 
However, we do not really care if you distribute or modify the code. 

If we were to allow contributions, we would suggest that you clone the repository,
work in a separate branch to main, and create a pull request when you have finished implementing whichever feature.
Also that during your development you follow our :doc:`Code Structure and Conventions`,
as well as writing unit tests for your code and following our :doc:`Error Handling and Debugging` procedure.
If you are contributing to the project, 
we would suggest starting with those features outlined in :doc:`Future Improvements`.

Alternatively, if you encounter any issues not mentioned in :doc:`Known Issues and Troubleshooting`, 
please submit issues to the github repository.
