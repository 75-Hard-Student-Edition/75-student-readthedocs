Prerequesites
******
The main prerequisite is compatible version of `flutter`_ (3.5.3 or later),
and a suitable platform to run the app. 
While flutter is nominally multi-platform, this app depends on certain iOS specific packages, 
and so can only be run on iOS.

The project also depends on a number of flutter packages. 
These may change as the app undergoes development.

A list of dependencies can be found in the ``pubspec.yaml`` file. 
Alternatively, a complete list of dependencies 
can be automatically generated by executing the command ``flutter pub deps`` 
from a terminal in the project directory. 
These dependencies can be automatically installed using ``flutter pub get``.

Installation Instructions
*****
This app does not have any official releases. To run the app, it will be necessary to install from source.
The source code for the app can be cloned from the `github repository`_.

The app can be run with by executing ``flutter run``.
Alternatively, some IDEs have flutter support, and so can run the app from the GUI.

On a non-iOS device, the app will load correctly, but will crash at a certain point through the app flow,
because of differences in the implementation of its dependencies across platforms.
