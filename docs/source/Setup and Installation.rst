Setup and Installation
======================
.. note:: This page is currently under development. Please check back later for updates.

This app does not have any official releases. To run the app, download the source code and compile it yourself. 

The source code for the app can be cloned from the `github repository`_.

The dependencies are listed in the ``pubspec.yaml`` file. 
This includes a compatible version of `flutter`_ (3.5.3 or later), and a suitable platform to run the app. 
While flutter is nominally multi-platform, this app depends on certain iOS specific packages, and so can only be run on iOS.
    
The project also depends on a number of flutter packages. These may change as the app undergoes development.
A complete list of dependencies can be automatically generated by executing the command ``flutter pub deps`` 
from a terminal in the project directory, and the dependencies can be automatically installed using ``flutter pub get``.
