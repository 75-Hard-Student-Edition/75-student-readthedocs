Setup and Installation
======================
.. note:: This page is currently under development. Please check back later for updates.

This app does not have any official releases. To run the app, download the source code and compile it yourself. 

The source code for the app can be cloned from `the github repository. https://github.com/75-Hard-Student-Edition/75-Student`_

The dependencies are listed in the ``pubspec.yaml`` file. 
This includes a compatible version of flutter (3.5.3 or later), and a suitable platform to run the app. 
While the app was designed to target iPhones, the multi-platform nature of flutter means it can be run on other operating systems or on a compatible browser.

The project also depends on a number of flutter packages. These may change as the app undergoes development.
A complete list of dependencies can be automatically generated by executing the command ``flutter pub deps`` 
from a terminal in the project directory, and the dependencies can be automatically installed using ``flutter pub get``.
